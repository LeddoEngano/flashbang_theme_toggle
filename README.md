## What the f*ck is this?

Ever wanted to switch from dark mode to light mode with the subtlety of a tactical flashbang grenade? Well, congratulations, you've found your new favorite useless tool.

This isn't just a theme toggle. This is a **weaponized** theme toggle that:
- Plays an actual flashbang sound when you leave the darkness
- Blinds you with a white screen for a solid few seconds (just like the real thing!)
- Makes you question your life choices while waiting for your vision to return
- Looks damn good while doing it

## Features That Nobody Asked For

- üéµ **Authentic flashbang audio** - Because silence is for cowards
- ‚ö° **Visual white-out effect** - Your retinas will thank you (they won't)
- üé® **Smooth theme transitions** - From darkness to "OH SH*T MY EYES"
- üì± **Responsive design** - Blind yourself on any device
- ‚ôø **Accessible** - Screen readers will announce your poor decisions
- üîí **Click protection** - Can't spam the grenade (safety first!)
